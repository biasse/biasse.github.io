I am the Director of an NSF-funded **Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site in Cryptography and Coding Theory** at the University of South Florida.
The program provides an intensive summer research experience for undergraduate students interested in
the mathematical foundations of modern cryptography, coding theory, and post-quantum security.

Participants work in small research teams under close faculty and graduate-student mentorship on open-ended
problems drawn from current topics in cryptography, computational number theory, and information theory.
In addition to research, the program integrates professional development sessions on research communication,
graduate-school preparation, and career pathways in academia and industry.

A central goal of the REU is to **broaden participation in mathematical research** by actively recruiting
students from institutions with limited research opportunities and from groups traditionally underrepresented
in mathematics and computer science. Many REU participants go on to present work at conferences, co-author
publications, and pursue graduate programs in mathematics, computer science, or related disciplines.

I am the Director of an NSF-funded **Research Training Group (RTG) in Applied Algebra** at the University of
South Florida. The RTG supports a coordinated set of research and training activities spanning multiple
career stages, including undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers.

The scientific focus of the RTG lies in **applied algebra with connections to cryptography, coding theory,
and quantum computing**. The program provides a structured mentoring environment, regular seminars and
reading groups, collaborative research projects, and opportunities for interdisciplinary interaction.

The RTG’s mission is to cultivate a vibrant research community and to equip trainees with the expertise
necessary for successful careers in research — whether in academia or industry. Trainees benefit from
rigorous mathematical training, computational exposure, and peer collaboration, making this a unique
and dynamic training ecosystem.
