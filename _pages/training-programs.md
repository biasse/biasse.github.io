### NSF REU Site in Cryptography and Coding Theory

I direct an NSF-funded **Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site** in Cryptography
and Coding Theory at the University of South Florida. The program provides intensive summer
research experiences for undergraduate students, with close faculty mentoring and an
emphasis on mathematical foundations of modern cryptography.

The REU aims to broaden participation in mathematical research and to prepare students for
graduate study and research careers.
