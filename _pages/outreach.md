**CodeBreakHERs** is a summer camp designed to broaden participation in computing and cybersecurity by providing a welcoming, hands-on introduction to core ideas in programming, online safety, and secure communication. The camp emphasizes learning-by-doing: students work through guided challenges, build small projects, and practice the kind of structured problem-solving that underlies modern security.

A key goal is to make cybersecurity concepts feel *accessible and empowering*. Activities are designed to connect to real digital life (passwords, messaging, privacy, authentication), while also highlighting the role of mathematics and logical reasoning. The program also includes mentoring and community-building components that help participants envision future pathways in STEM.

The **USF Crypto Center YouTube channel** collects educational material aligned with the Center’s activities in cryptography and coding theory, including lecture-style explanations, course support videos (e.g., problem-solving tutorials), and research-seminar content.

It is meant to be useful both as a companion to coursework and as an outreach resource for anyone who wants a structured entry point into modern cryptography.

</div>

**_Locke and Keya_** is a series of short animated videos that uses storytelling to introduce cybersecurity ideas through situations that feel familiar and concrete. The goal is to make concepts like secure browsing and communication privacy intuitive by embedding them in short narratives that are easy to share in classrooms and outreach events. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

Rather than presenting cybersecurity as a list of rules, the series emphasizes how adversaries think, what signals digital systems leak, and which habits improve privacy and security in everyday life—without requiring a technical background.
