## Outreach

### CodeBreakHERs Summer Camp

I direct and support **CodeBreakHERs**, a free cybersecurity summer camp for middle- and
high-school students at the University of South Florida. The program introduces participants
to core cybersecurity concepts — including cryptography, error-correcting codes, hardware
security, and internet security — through hands-on activities and interactive modules.

CodeBreakHERs aims to broaden participation in cybersecurity and computing by engaging
students from underrepresented groups at an early stage.
