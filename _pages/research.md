## Research

My research focuses on the mathematical foundations of modern cryptography, including
post-quantum cryptography, code-based cryptography, isogeny-based cryptography,
computational number theory, and quantum algorithms. I am particularly interested in the
algorithmic hardness of algebraic problems underlying cryptographic constructions and in
the design of efficient classical and quantum algorithms.
