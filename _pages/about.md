I am a Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of South Florida and Director of the Center for Cryptographic Research.

My research lies at the intersection of **cryptography, computational number theory, coding theory, and quantum algorithms**, with a focus on post-quantum cryptography and algebraic methods for cryptanalysis. I have held visiting and postdoctoral positions at the University of Waterloo, the University of Calgary, UC Berkeley, and the University of Sydney.

I am the recipient of a **CAREER Award from the National Science Foundation**, a **Fulbright Scholar Award**, and the **Killam Laureate Award**. I currently direct NSF-funded **REU** and **RTG** training programs in cryptography and applied algebra.
