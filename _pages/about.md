I am a Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of South Florida and Director of the Center for Cryptographic Research.

My research lies at the intersection of **cryptography, computational number theory, coding theory, and quantum algorithms**, with a focus on post-quantum cryptography and algebraic methods for cryptanalysis. I have held visiting and postdoctoral positions at the University of Waterloo, the University of Calgary, UC Berkeley, and the University of Sydney.

In addition to my research and teaching, I am actively involved in research training and outreach. I direct NSF-funded **Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)** and **Research Training Group (RTG)** programs at the University of South Florida, which support research training across multiple career stages in cryptography, coding theory, and applied algebra. I am also the director of **CodeBreakHERs**, a summer cybersecurity camp designed to broaden participation in computing, and I contribute to educational outreach through the **USF Crypto Center YouTube channel**, which hosts lecture-style and seminar-oriented content. I currently serve as an associate editor for the *International Journal of Computer Mathematics: Computer Systems Theory*.
